# three-js-blobtree
A library to manage implicit surfaces in THREE.JS applications using a Blobtree.

# Dependencies
This library currently depends on node module Three-full which is packaging all THREE.JS sources, including extras like examples.

# TODO

## Dep to Three-full
For now we ue common require method. We should probably use import syntax, so that it is possible to build a light bundle from those sources.
