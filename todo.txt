- Create test for all analytical gradient using numercalGradient to compare the results.
- Nodes for "blending" distances : ie use distance field combination to compute distance fields to the union, intersection, difference.

- Matrix transformation for distance fields.

// Code cleaning
- AreaScalisPoint is deprecated and has been replaced in ScalisPoint with AreaSphere.
  Before definitely removing the code, it would be necessary to create a test which would compare
  all results of the two classes with given parameters to check that it is the same.
- Thickness in  SCALIS should be renamed radius, or be divided by 2... (bad naming)
